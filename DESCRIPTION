Title: Two-Stagewise Log-Contrast Model for Microbiome Differential Abundance Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Robert Beblavy

Description: This package is used for identifying biologically relevant to phenotype (BRp) taxa
  using L1 penalized log contrast models. In the first stage, this method finds differentially abundant (DA)
  functions using an L1 penalized probit log contrast model. In the second stage, this method looks at each
  function identified as DA in the first stage, and uses an L1 penalized log contrast model to identify those
  taxa that are significantly associated with the identified DA function.

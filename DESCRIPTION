Title: Two-Stagewise Log-Contrast Model for Microbiome Differential Abundance Analysis

Description: This package is used for performing differential abundance analysis of taxa conditional
  on their functional differences using L1 penalized log contrast models. In the first stage, this
  method finds differentially abundant functions (genes or gene pathways) using an L1 penalized
  probit log contrast model. In the second stage, this method looks at each function identified as
  differentially abundant, and uses an L1 penalized log contrast model to perform differential abundance
  analysis on the taxa associated with that function. The goal is to find those differentially abundant
  taxa that are associated with differences in phenotype, rather than all of the differentially abundant taxa.

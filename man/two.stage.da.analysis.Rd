\title{Run The Two-Stagewise Method for Differential Abundance Analysis}
\usage{
two.stage.da.analysis(y, fun_prof, tax_prof, Fjs, x, cutoff = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector with elements from {0, 1} to indicate which population each sample belongs to. The order
of the elements of y must match the order of the samples in the rows of the functional profile, taxonomic
profile, and matrix of covariates.}

\item{fun_prof}{A matrix with the data for the functional profile. The rows must be samples with a column Sample_Name to indicate the sample IDs. The remaining columns must be for the pathways. Note that the abundances of each sample must be converted to proportions in order for this to work. Also, the order of the rows must match the order of the samples in the response vector.}

\item{tax_prof}{A matrix with the data for the taxonomic profile. The rows must be samples with a column Sample_Name to indicate the sample IDs. The remaining columns must be for the pathways. Note that the abundances of each sample must be converted to proportions in order for this to work. Also, the order of the rows must match the order of the samples in the response vector.}

\item{Fjs}{A list where the names of the list are the same as the column names of the functional profile,
and each element of the list is a vector indicating which microbes in the taxonomic profile are associated
with the corresponding function. The elements of the vector can be given as either column indices or names.}

\item{x}{A matrix where the samples are rows and the columns are covariates to be adjusted for in the model.
The rownames must match up to those of the functional and taxonomic profile, and any NA values must be
removed from this matrix before running the method.}

\item{pwy_cutoff}{A number to indicate which threshold the p-value for the pathways should be cutoff at. All pathways with a p-value below this threshold will be detected as DA.}
}

\item{tax_cutoff}{A number to indicate which threshold the p-value for the taxa should be cutoff at. All taxa with a p-value below this threshold will be detected as DA. To correct for multiple comparisons, we use the Benjamini-Hochberg method.}

\value{
This function returns a list with the following element.

associated.da.taxa: A list where the names are each function identified as differentially abundant and the elements of the list are vectors containing all associated differentially abundant taxa.

}
\description{
This is a function that takes a vector indicating the group membership, the functional profile,
the taxonomic profile, a list containing all taxa associated with each function, and a matrix of covariates and runs the two-stagewise approach to finding differentially abundant taxa given differentially abundant functions.

#' columns contain the sample IDs. The first column must have the name X..Pathway.

  ### Step 2: Get vector with func|g__.s__

  ### Step 3: Construct data frame with species from each pathway name

#' Run The Two-Stagewise Method for Differential Abundance Analysis
#'
#' This is a function that takes a vector indicating the group membership, the functional profile,
#' the taxonomic profile, a list containing all taxa associated with each function, and a matrix of covariates.
#' It runs the two-stagewise approach to finding DA taxa given DA functions and returns a list of DA taxa
#' assocaiated with each DA function.
#'
#' @param y A vector with elements from {0, 1} to indicate which population each sample belongs to. The order
#' of the elements of y must match the order of the samples in the rows of the functional profile, taxonomic
#' profile, and matrix of covariates.
#' @param fun_prof A matrix with the data for the functional profile. The rows must be samples with a column
#' Sample_Name to indicate the sample IDs. The remaining columns must be for the pathways. Note that the
#' abundances of each sample must be converted to proportions in order for this to work. Also, the order of
#' the rows must match the order of the samples in the response vector.
#' @param tax_prof A matrix with the data for the taxonomic profile. The rows must be samples with a column
#' Sample_Name to indicate the sample IDs. The remaining columns must be for the pathways. Note that the
#' abundances of each sample must be converted to proportions in order for this to work. Also, the order of
#' the rows must match the order of the samples in the response vector.
#' @param Fjs A list where the names of the list are the same as the column names of the functional profile,
#' and each element of the list is a vector indicating which microbes in the taxonomic profile are associated
#' with the corresponding function. The elements of the vector can be given as either column indices or names.
#' @param x A matrix where the samples are rows and the columns are covariates to be adjusted for in the model.
#' The rownames must match up to those of the functional and taxonomic profile, and any NA values must be
#' removed from this matrix before running the method.
#' @param pwy_cutoff A number to indicate which threshold the p-value for the pathways should be cutoff at. All
#' pathways with a p-value below this threshold will be detected as DA.
#' @param tax_cutoff A number to indicate which threshold the p-value for the taxa should be cutoff at. All
#' taxa with a p-value below this threshold will be detected as DA. To correct for
#' multiple comparisons, we use the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

#' @return This function returns the following:

Title: Two-Stagewise Log-Contrast Model for Microbiome Differential Abundance Analysis
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package is used for performing differential abundance analysis of functions conditional
  on their functional differences using an L1 penalized probit regression model with a linear constraint on the
  parameters. In the first stage, this method finds differentially abundant functions (genes or gene pathways.)
  In the second stage, this method looks at each function identified as differentially abundant, and uses
  the same model to perform differential abundance analysis on the taxa associated with that function. The goal
  is to find those differentially abundant taxa that are associated with differences in phenotype, rather than
  all of the differentially abundant taxa.
